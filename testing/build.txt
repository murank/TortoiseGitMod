   Build libraries, and copy the libraries (Release and Debug version of gmock.lib) into "testing/lib". 
   NB: Build the libraries with multithreaded DLL of the run-time library (use /MD* options),
       and rename Debug version of "gmock.lib" to "gmockd.lib" to avoid conflict of filenames.
   And also copy "gmock" directory that is in "include" directory into "testing/include",
