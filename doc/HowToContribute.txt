Checklist (and a short version for the impatient):

	Commits:

	- make commits of (small) logical units
	- check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check"
	  before committing
	- do not check in commented out code or unneeded files
	- the first line of the commit message should be a short
	  description and should skip the full stop. If it is about a
	  bugreport/issue, prepend "Fixed issue #NUMBER: " to the subject.
	- the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
	  . explains the problem the change tries to solve, iow, what
	    is wrong with the current code without the change.
	  . justifies the way the change solves the problem, iow, why
	    the result with the change is better.
	  . alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any.
	- describe changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
	  instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed
	  xyzzy to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase
	  to change its behaviour.
	- try to make sure your explanation can be understood without
	  external resources. Instead of giving a URL to a mailing list
	  archive, summarize the relevant points of the discussion.
	- add a "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>" line to the
	  commit message (or just use the option "-s" when committing)
	  to confirm that you agree to the Developer's Certificate of Origin

	Submission:
	
	- open an issue on http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ or go to an
	  issue you want to fix. Then you have one of the following options:
	  . attach a patch there
	  . provide a link to a branch you want the maintainers to pull from
	  . open a github pull request and put the link into the issue

Longer version:

(0) Make separate commits for logically separate changes.

Unless your patch is really trivial, you should not be sending
out a patch that was generated between your working tree and
your commit head.  Instead, always make a commit with complete
commit message and generate a series of patches from your
repository.

Give an explanation for the change(s) that is detailed enough so
that people can judge if it is good thing to do, without reading
the actual patch text to determine how well the code does what
the explanation promises to do.

If your description starts to get too long, that's a sign that you
probably need to split up your commit to finer grained pieces.
That being said, patches which plainly describe the things that
help reviewers check the patch, and future maintainers understand
the code, are the most beautiful patches.  Descriptions that summarise
the point in the subject well, and describe the motivation for the
change, the approach taken by the change, and if relevant how this
differs substantially from the prior version, are all good things
to have.

Oh, another thing. We are picky about whitespaces. To help ensure this
does not happen, run git diff --check on your changes before you commit.


(1a) Generate your patch using git tools out of your commits (Patch serial)

git based diff tools generate unidiff which is the preferred format.

Please make sure your patch does not include any extra files
which do not belong in a patch submission.  Make sure to review
your patch after generating it, to ensure accuracy.  Before
sending out, please make sure it cleanly applies to the "master"
branch head.


(1b) Create a pull request

Push your changes to a public repository. Use a brief branch name
describing your changes.

Please make sure your pull request does not include any extra files
which do not belong in a submission.  Make sure to review your patch
after generating it, to ensure accuracy.

There is no need to generate a "formal" pull request. The URL and
branchname is necessary - or create a github pull request
(https://github.com/TortoiseGit).


(2) Sign your work

To improve tracking of who did what, we've borrowed the
"sign-off" procedure from the Linux kernel project on patches
that are being emailed around.  Although TortoiseGit is a lot
smaller project it is a good discipline to follow it.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for
the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have
the right to pass it on as a open-source patch.  The rules are
pretty simple: if you can certify the below:

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

	(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
	    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
	    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
	    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
	    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line saying

	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

This line can be automatically added by Git and TortoiseGit.

Also notice that a real name is used in the Signed-off-by: line. Please
don't hide your real name.

If you like, you can put extra tags at the end:

1. "Reported-by:" is used to credit someone who found the bug that
   the patch attempts to fix.
2. "Acked-by:" says that the person who is more familiar with the area
   the patch attempts to modify liked the patch.
3. "Reviewed-by:", unlike the other tags, can only be offered by the
   reviewer and means that she is completely satisfied that the patch
   is ready for application.  It is usually offered only after a
   detailed review.
4. "Tested-by:" is used to indicate that the person applied the patch
   and found it to have the desired effect.

You can also create your own tag or use one that's in common usage
such as "Thanks-to:", "Based-on-patch-by:", or "Mentored-by:".

------------------------------------------------
An ideal patch flow

Here is an ideal patch flow for this project the current maintainer
suggests to the contributors:

 (0) You come up with an itch.  You code it up.

 (1) Open an issue on http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ or attach
     your changes to another already reported issue. Attach the patches
     or provide a pull request (URL branch) there.

 (2) You get comments and suggestions for improvements.  You may
     even get them in a "on top of your change" patch form.

 (3) Polish, refine, and re-send.  Go back to step (2).

 (4) The patch will be applied to master.
